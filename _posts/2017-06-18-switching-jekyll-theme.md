Now we switch to a more advanced [Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). 
The difficulty, however, is adjusting the new Theme to the Requirements of AMP.
This is going to take some time.

### The Steps I took Today:
1. [Setup](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)

### Next Steps
1. migrate Theme
